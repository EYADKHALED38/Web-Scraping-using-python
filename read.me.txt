This Python script demonstrates advanced web
 scraping techniques to extract real estate property
 data from the Realtor.com website. It uses pagination
 to scrape multiple pages of search results for a specific
 location and search criteria and extracts relevant information
 such as price, address, city, state, zipcode, beds, baths,
 and square footage. The extracted data is stored in a list
 of dictionaries and then written to a CSV file for further
 analysis and manipulation. This powerful tool can be customized
 to scrape different locations and search parameters and can provide
 valuable insights for real estate professionals and investors.
